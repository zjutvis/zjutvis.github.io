abstract = "Visual analytics employs interactive visualizations to integrate users’ knowledge and inference capability into numerical/algorithmic data analysis processes. It is an active research field that has applications in many sectors, such as security, finance, and business. The growing popularity of visual analytics in recent years creates the need for a broad survey that reviews and assesses the recent developments in the field. This report reviews and classifies recent work into a set of application categories including space and time, multivariate, text, graph and network, and other applications. More importantly, this report presents analytics space, inspired by design space, which relates each application category to the key steps in visual analytics, including visual mapping, model-based analysis, and user interactions. We explore and discuss the analytics space to add the current understanding and better understand research trends in the field."
