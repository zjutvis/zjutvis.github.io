abstract = "Geo-tagged microblog data covers billions of movement patterns on a global and local scale. Understanding these patterns could guide urban and traffic planning or help coping with disaster situations. We present a visual analytics system to investigate travel trajectories of people reconstructed from microblog messages. To analyze seasonal changes and events and to validate movement patterns against other data sources, we contribute highly interactive visual comparison methods that normalize and contrast trajectories as well as density maps within a single view. We also compute an adaptive hierarchical graph from the trajectories to abstract individual movements into higher-level structures. Specific challenges that we tackle are, among others, the spatio-temporal sparsity of the data, the volume of data varying by region, and a diverse mix of means of transportation. The applicability of our approach is presented in three case studies."
