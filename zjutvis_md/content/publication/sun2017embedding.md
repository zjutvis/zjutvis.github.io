abstract = "Analysis and exploration of spatio-temporal data such as traffic flow and vehicle trajectories have become important in urban planning and management. In this paper, we present a novel visualization technique called route-zooming that can embed spatio-temporal information into a map seamlessly for occlusion-free visualization of both spatial and temporal data. The proposed technique can broaden a selected route in a map by deforming the overall road network. We formulate the problem of route-zooming as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem by defining an energy function that ensures the route is broadened successfully on demand while the distortion caused to the road network is minimized. The spatio-temporal information can then be embedded into the route to reveal both spatial and temporal patterns without occluding the spatial context information. The route-zooming technique is applied in two instantiations including an interactive metro map for city tourism and illustrative maps to highlight information on the broadened roads to prove its applicability. We demonstrate the usability of our spatio-temporal visualization approach with case studies on real traffic flow data. We also study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and choices of temporal display, and conduct a comprehensive user study to validate our embedded visualization design."
