abstract = "Spatial visualization has always been a primary part of information visualization and analysis, especially in the era of big data. The map, the most fundamental components of spatial visualization, is a kind of simple, intuitive and popular way to show the visualization of geographic information. The traditional map is not convenient to overlay complex elements due to its own complex filled color and the actual geographical boundaries. We aim to cut off dusty foliage of the maps, and deliver the main structure of the map visualization result. We proposes RectMap, a boundary-reserved map deformation approach for visualizing geographical map, which can maintain the mind map of original map. The proposed approach integrate traditional Douglas-Peucker algorithm and our Gridding algorithm. The Douglas-Peucker algorithm generates a simplified map, and the Gridding algorithm optimizes the initial simplified map. Case study and user study are further conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the new-style map."
