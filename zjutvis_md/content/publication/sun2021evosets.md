abstract = "Dimensionality reduction is commonly used for identifying and analyzing patterns in the visual analysis of multi-dimensional datasets. The selection of subspaces is a core building block in projecting high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space, which is usually illustrated as a scatterplot for analysts to easily understand and explore. This process involves human prior knowledge and domain-specific requirements. Thus, quantifying and tracking the changes of projections across subspaces remain challenging. Existing methods can neither quantify the subsets-based changes of dimensionality reduction results when switching subspaces nor automatically and comprehensively display overall and subtle differences among dimensionality reduction results.To address this, we developed EvoSets, a novel visual analytics system designed to help users understand how subspaces affect dimensionality reduction results. The effects are quantified based on subsets' distribution to tracking the sensitivity of dimensionality reduction results across subspaces. System supports the exploration of the overall evolution of the dimensionality reduction results for helping users track the convergence and divergence behavior changes of subsets based on an extended Bubble Sets visualization. Similarities are intuitively illustrated, and dissimilarities are highlighted among projections based on layout constraints. The usefulness and effectiveness are evaluated with a user study and two case studies on multi-dimensional datasets."
